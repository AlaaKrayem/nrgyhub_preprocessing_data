# nrgyhub_preprocessing_data
# These Jupyter notebooks are used during the pre-processing of the datasets used to develop the NRGYHUB data portal. The data are visualized on https://nrgyhub.mdu.se/.
# In the first file, 1_qgis.ipynb, LIDAR data were processed to generate the Digital Serrain Model (DSM) of the city of V채ster책s, while raster data were used to generate the Digital Terrrian Model (DTM). 
# The LIDAR and raster data were donwloaded from Lantm채teriet geodatabase open for research institution in Sweden. 
# The DSM and DTM were then used to estimate the buildings' heights in the city. 
# In the second file, 2_process_buildings_addresses_properties.ipynb, datastes of buildings, properties and addresses in teh city were pre-processed to remove unnecessary information, interconnect them, add the computed buildings heights ...
# These two files can be used by any institution, university, municipality or company looking to replicate the work we achieved in the NRGYHUB project. 
# The datasets themselves cannot be shared by us and therefore it is the responsability of the interested party to request the data from Lantm채teriet.
